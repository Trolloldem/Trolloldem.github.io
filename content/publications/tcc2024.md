This work addresses the problem of indexing encrypted data
outsourced to an external cloud server to support server-side execution 
of multi-attribute queries. The described approach partitions the
dataset in groups with the same number of tuples, and associates
all tuples in a group with the same combination of index values,
so to guarantee protection against static inferences. The proposed indexing
approach does not require any modifications to the server-side
software stack, and requires limited storage at the client for query
support. The experimental evaluation considers, for the storage
of the encrypted and indexed dataset, both a relational database
(PostgreSQL) and a key-value database (Redis). The paper includes
extensive experiments evaluating client-storage requirements and
query performance. The experimental results confirm the efficiency
of the solution. The proposal is supported by an open source
implementation.
