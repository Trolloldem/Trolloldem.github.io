This journal article investigate how it is possible to distribute the 
Mondrian algorithm to obtain K-Anonymity and L-diversity: two well-known 
privacy metrics that guarantee protection of the respondents of a dataset 
by obfuscating information that can disclose their identities and 
sensitive information. The motivation of this work is that existing 
solutions for enforcing them implicitly assume to operate in a 
centralized scenario, since they require complete visibility over the 
dataset to be anonymized, and can therefore have limited applicability 
in anonymizing large datasets. This paper propose a solution that extends 
Mondrian to allow its employment on large datasets in a distributed manner, 
leveraging the parallel computation of multiple workers. The presented 
approach efficiently distributes the computation among the workers, without 
requiring visibility over the dataset in its entirety. The data partitioning 
limits the need for workers to exchange data, so that each worker can 
independently anonymize a portion of the dataset. We implemented our approach 
providing parallel execution on a dynamically chosen number of workers. The 
experimental evaluation shows that our solution provides scalability, while 
not affecting the quality of the resulting anonymization.
