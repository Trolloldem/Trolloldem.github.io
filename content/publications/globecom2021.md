##### This description will be updated after the presentation of the paper
In this work we proposed an approach to enable query execution over encrypted
datasets. The approach is composed of two phases: preprocessing and runtime.
During the preprocessing phase,
we build client-side mappings and uses them to wrap the
dataset accordingly.
At runtime, queries are caught and rewritten in such a way that the server is
able to perform queries without decrypting the data collection.
The experiments performed in this work show that the runtime overhead of our
solution is negligible.
