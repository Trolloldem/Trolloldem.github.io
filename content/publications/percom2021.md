In this demo paper is presented an approach for enabling a distributed
anonymization process over large collections of sensor data. The described
approach anonymizes large datasets (which might not fit in main
memory) using an arbitrary number of workers within the Spark
framework. We describe how to parallelize the anonymization
process through a proper partitioning of the dataset. The
experimental evaluation performed shows that the proposed approach is
scalable and do not affect the quality of the anonymized dataset.
