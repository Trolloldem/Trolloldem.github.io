**MSc in Computer Engineering** (110 cum laude) at [University of Bergamo](https://www.unibg.it/).

### My Master thesis
In my master thesis **Semantic for ODRL policy merging**â€‹ I've contributed to the [MOSAICrOWN](https://mosaicrown.eu/) project.
My work was part of the Work Package 2 of MOSAICrOWN: **Policy specifications - Data governance framework**.
The main focus of the thesis was to explore the ODRL Policy Language and to propose a system to support the process of merging two conflicting policies.
During this project I've explored the following technologies:
* ODRL
* RDF
* RDF serializations (JSON-LD, Turtle,...)
* SPARQL
* Semantic web
* Apache Jena

The proposal was implemented in Java and leveraged Maven.

### Other studies
During this course of studies, I've realized projects using the following technologies:
* Rest Services
* API configuration (for example Paypal API)
* JSON
* Apache Tomcat
* Computer vision (for example leveraging [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose))
* ANTLR 4 (main component of [this project](https://github.com/Trolloldem/D-D5e_automatic_char_sheet) created during the "Compilers and Languages" exam)
* Firebase
* MongoDB
* Git and SVN
* Web Sockets
* Scala and Spark
* Pandas, numpy, SciPy, scikit-learn and matplotlib
* Natural Language Processing
* Rust

These technologies has been part of various projects done during exams or for personal interest.

**BSc in Computer Engineering** (110/110) at [University of Bergamo](https://www.unibg.it/).

### My thesis
In my thesis **Adding dynamic contents to IPFS through a Decentralized Application** I've developed an example of
web application with a fully decentralized architecture. The main technologies used to develop this application were:
* IPFS, used as a web server to distribute static contents
* Ethereum, used as application layer
* BigchainDB, used as data layer

The web application was a platform to sell train tickets online. This example was then used to discuss the key
advantages and eventual disadvantages of a fully decentralized architecture compared to a classic centralized
architecture.
During this project, I've had also the opporturnity to use:
* Javascript
* Bootstrap
* npm
* React
* Solidity

### Other studies
During this course of studies, I've learned the following programming languages:
* C and C++
* Java
* Python (2 and 3)
* PHP
* SQL

As part of the studies done in this period, I've also learned to use some software
modelling languages (for example UML and E-R schemas).
